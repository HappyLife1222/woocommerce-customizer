Helps you customize WooCommerce without writing any code!

== Description ==

WooCommerce includes tons of filters to let you customize button text, labels, and more, but you have to write PHP
code to use them. This plugin provides a settings page where you can add your customizations and save them without
needing to write any code or modify any templates, which is helpful for quick change testing.

> Requires WooCommerce 2.4.13+

Here are some customizations you can make:

*   Add to Cart button text for all product types (within the shop loop and on a single product page)
*   The number of products displayed per page
*   Heading text for the 'Product Description' and 'Additional Information' tab.
*   Checkout page coupon / login text
*   Checkout page "Create Account" checkbox default
*   Checkout page 'Submit Order' button text
*   Tax Label text
*   Placeholder image source

To make these changes, go to **WooCommerce &gt; Settings** and view the "Customizer" tab.

> **Note**: This plugin does not support multisite and cannot be network activated. To use this on a multisite network, you must install the plugin individually on each site.

= Support Details =
We do support our free plugins and extensions, but please understand that support for premium products takes priority. We typically check the forums every few days (with a maximum delay of one week).

3. Go to the 'Customizer' tab under WooCommerce &gt; Settings

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I customize xyz? =

Most likely because a filter does not yet exist within WooCommerce, or a filter does exist but is too complicated to be of use with this plugin.

= Why don't the settings show up under the WooCommerce Settings? =

Do you have this network activated for a multisite installation? If so, you'll need to remove the plugin, then install it on each child site as needed, as the plugin does not support being network activated.

= I found a bug! What do I do? =

Please submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/skyverge/woocommerce-customizer/) along with a description of the problem so we can fix it :)
